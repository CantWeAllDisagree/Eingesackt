**Eingesackt** or *(Bagged)* is a planned to be lightweight, modular, 
portable storage mod themed around backpacks with optional configurable features

---
## **THIS IS A EARLY WIP PROJECT** 

### **There will be bugs / issues and incomplete features**


Eingesackt is a fork of [Inmis](https://github.com/Draylar/inmis) & [InmisAddon](https://github.com/Globox1997/InmisAddon) 
Why have 2 mods for backpacks when you could just have one! 

Built on [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) & [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) 

Mod for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) 1.19.2


By default, you can right-click a Backpack to open it, or press `B` to open the first Backpack available in your inventory.
Backpacks can be equipped in the Chest-plate armor slot and opened through the same keybinding.

## Compatibility

If you install [Trinkets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trinkets-fabric) alongside Eingesackt, you will be able to equip Backpacks in the Trinket slot.

For previewing Backpacks, try out [ShulkerBoxTooltip](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/shulkerboxtooltip)!

If you find any compatibility issue's make sure to post in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CantWeAllDisagree/Eingesackt/issues)
